# Hunt-ed-
Student 3D FPS game project.

# About that game
Hunt(ed) is a student project, developed within 2 months for the purpose of a Licence lesson unit at the University of Strasbourg. 
It is not meant to be sold nor distributed. It should only be shared as a skill demonstration. Yet, you are allowed to have fun with it.

Note : We recommend good headphones for an optimal experience.
